                        Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter known for his vivid colors and emotional
                        intensity. Born in 1853, he created over 2,100 works, including masterpieces like "Starry Night"
                        and "Sunflowers." Despite his struggles with mental health and financial hardships, his
                        innovative style profoundly influenced modern art, making him a celebrated figure today.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh was born on March 30th, 1853 in a small town in the Netherlands. He was the oldest of his
            siblings to survive and was named after his grandfather, Vincent, who was a very successful scholar. As a
            child, Van Gogh was very serious and very thoughtful towards his family. His passion for art started at a
            very young age after his parents sent him to a private middle school where he became extremely unhappy. His
            mother was the one who encouraged his artworks, and at this middle school, he was taught by a Constantijn C.
            Huysmans. Huysmans was a very successful painter in Paris during the early 1800's. However, this did little
            to ensure his happiness and he returned home in 1868. He expressed his childhood as "austere and cold and
            sterile".</p>
